# Stock Price Prediction

This repository contains code and data for a machine learning project focused on predicting stock prices at Saudi Arabian Oil Company (2222.SR). The project uses historical stock market data to train regression models and make predictions on future prices.

This is one of my tasks as a Data Science Intern at the virtual internship from [**Bharat Intern**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bharat-intern).
